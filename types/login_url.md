### Basic Template

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from surfgram.types import LoginUrl

class MyLoginUrlHandler(LoginUrl):
    """"""
    
    @property
    def __is_active__(self) -> bool:
        return True  # Set False to disable
        
    @property
    def __names__(self) -> List[str]:
        return []  # ['specific_trigger'] for filtered handling
        
    @property
    def __callback__(self) -> Callable:
        return self.process_event
        
    async def process_event(self, update: dict, bot) -> None:
        """Main handler logic"""
        # Implement your processing here
```

### Field Reference

The update object contains these fields:

| Field          | Type              | Description                     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `url` | `str` | An HTTPS URL to be opened with user authorization data added to the query string when the button is pressed. If the user refuses to provide authorization data, the original URL without information about the user will be opened. The data added is the same as described in Receiving authorization data.NOTE: You must always check the hash of the received data to verify the authentication and the integrity of the data as described in Checking authorization. |
| `forward_text` | `str` | Optional. New text of the button in forwarded messages. |
| `bot_username` | `str` | Optional. Username of a bot, which will be used for user authorization. See Setting up a bot for more details. If not specified, the current bot's username will be assumed. The url's domain must be the same as the domain linked with the bot. See Linking your domain to the bot for more details. |
| `request_write_access` | `bool` | Optional. Pass True to request the permission for your bot to send messages to the user. |

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: 
   - Use descriptive class names (`PaymentHandler` vs `Handler1`)
   - Prefix related handlers (`AdminCommands`, `UserCommands`)
