## Implementation Guide

### Basic Template

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from surfgram.types import BusinessConnection

class MyBusinessConnectionHandler(BusinessConnection):    
    @property
    def __is_active__(self) -> bool:
        return True  # Set False to disable
        
    @property
    def __names__(self) -> List[str]:
        return []  # ['specific_trigger'] for filtered handling
        
    @property
    def __callback__(self) -> Callable:
        return self.process_event
        
    async def process_event(self, update: dict, bot) -> None:
        """Main handler logic"""
        # Implement your processing here
```

### Field Reference

The update object contains these fields:

| Field          | Type              | Description                     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier of the business connection |
| `user` | `User` | Business account user that created the business connection |
| `user_chat_id` | `int` | Identifier of a private chat with the user who created the business connection. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier. |
| `date` | `int` | Date the connection was established in Unix time |
| `rights` | `BusinessBotRights` | Optional. Rights of the business bot |
| `is_enabled` | `bool` | True, if the connection is active |

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: 
   - Use descriptive class names (`PaymentHandler` vs `Handler1`)
   - Prefix related handlers (`AdminCommands`, `UserCommands`)
