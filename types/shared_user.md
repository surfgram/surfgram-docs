| Property        | Type               | Required | Default | Description                              |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|

| `__names__`     | `List[str]`        | No       | `[]`    | Trigger filter (empty = all)            |
| `__callback__`  | `Callable`         | **Yes**  | -       | Async handler function                  |

## Implementation Guide

### Basic Template

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from surfgram.types import SharedUser

class MySharedUserHandler(SharedUser):    
    @property
    def __is_active__(self) -> bool:
        return True  # Set False to disable
        
    @property
    def __names__(self) -> List[str]:
        return []  # ['specific_trigger'] for filtered handling
        
    @property
    def __callback__(self) -> Callable:
        return self.process_event
        
    async def process_event(self, update: dict, bot) -> None:
        """Main handler logic"""
        # Implement your processing here
```

### Field Reference

The update object contains these fields:

| Field          | Type              | Description                     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `user_id` | `int` | Identifier of the shared user. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so 64-bit integers or double-precision float types are safe for storing these identifiers. The bot may not have access to the user and could be unable to use this identifier, unless the user is already known to the bot by some other means. |
| `first_name` | `str` | Optional. First name of the user, if the name was requested by the bot |
| `last_name` | `str` | Optional. Last name of the user, if the name was requested by the bot |
| `username` | `str` | Optional. Username of the user, if the username was requested by the bot |
| `photo` | `List[PhotoSize]` | Optional. Available sizes of the chat photo, if the photo was requested by the bot |

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: 
   - Use descriptive class names (`PaymentHandler` vs `Handler1`)
   - Prefix related handlers (`AdminCommands`, `UserCommands`)
