|-----------------|--------------------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|

## Implementation Guide

### Basic Template

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from surfgram.types import ChatJoinRequest

class MyChatJoinRequestHandler(ChatJoinRequest):    
    @property
    def __is_active__(self) -> bool:
        return True  # Set False to disable
        
    @property
    def __names__(self) -> List[str]:
        return []  # ['specific_trigger'] for filtered handling
        
    @property
    def __callback__(self) -> Callable:
        return self.process_event
        
    async def process_event(self, update: dict, bot) -> None:
        """Main handler logic"""
        # Implement your processing here
```

### Field Reference

The update object contains these fields:

| Field          | Type              | Description                     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `chat` | `Chat` | Chat to which the request was sent |
| `from` | `User` | User that sent the join request |
| `user_chat_id` | `int` | Identifier of a private chat with the user who sent the join request. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier. The bot can use this identifier for 5 minutes to send messages until the join request is processed, assuming no other administrator contacted the user. |
| `date` | `int` | Date the request was sent in Unix time |
| `bio` | `str` | Optional. Bio of the user. |
| `invite_link` | `ChatInviteLink` | Optional. Chat invite link that was used by the user to send the join request |

## Best Practices

1. **Naming**: 
   - Use descriptive class names (`PaymentHandler` vs `Handler1`)
   - Prefix related handlers (`AdminCommands`, `UserCommands`)
